            <br>
            IN CONSIDERATION of the promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

          </p>
          <p>b.	“Use” means the loading, accessing, copying (to the extent permitted herein), employment, utilization, storage or display of the Software solely for Subscriber’s business purposes by Subscriber, Subscriber’s employees, customers, consumers, or by independent contractors hired by Subscriber, each of whom have a subscription granted pursuant to Section 2 hereof and have agreed in writing to comply with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the term “business purposes,” as used herein, does not include, among other things, the right to (a) send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of applicable laws; (b) send or store infringing, obscene, threatening, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, including material harmful to third party privacy rights; or (c) send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs. Subscriber agrees to report immediately to Iapps24, and to use best efforts to stop immediately, any unauthorized copying or distribution of the Software that is known or suspected by Subscriber.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
          <h4> 2.	Subscription, Services and Fees.</h4> <br>
          </p>
          <p>a. Subscription Fee. In consideration for the Software subscription and services granted under this Agreement, Subscriber agrees to pay Iapps24 pursuant to the subscription services plan and pricing plan, as selected by Subscriber at http://proferral.net/pricing. By upgrading account through app store the Subscriber agrees to pay the Subscription Fee which corresponds to designated subscription services plan and pricing plan as selected by Subscriber. <br>
            <br>
            No additional services will be accepted as a part of the scope of this Agreement. Any changes in services outside of the scope of this Agreement must be agreed to in writing by both parties, and shall be billed by Iapps24 to Subscriber pursuant to a newly selected subscription services plan and pricing plan, or pursuant to a Schedule of Payment attached to such written document reflecting the change(s) in services. <br>
            <br>
            b. Subscription Scope and Support Services. Iapps24 agrees to provide access to all default modules that are part of the basic application functions and that are required to provide professional services, support, consulting and development services pursuant to this Agreement. Subscriber agrees to pay for any other optional third party services provided by Iapps24 through its partners. <br>
          </p>
          <p>c. Unpaid Fees. Fees not paid by Subscriber pursuant to the Schedule of Payment, or those not paid pursuant to an automatic renewal of this Agreement, will be subject to a finance charge at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is greater, in addition to all collection expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. <br>
          </p>
          <p>d. Security of Payment. As a condition to its subscription, Subscriber must provide Iapps24 with a valid credit card number or approved billing information. Subscriber agrees to provide Iapps24 with complete, accurate and current billing and contact information. In the event any such billing or contact information becomes incomplete or inaccurate, Subscriber agrees to immediately provide Iapps24 with current and accurate information.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            e. Service Implementation. Subscriber agrees to use the Software only through its website or Software application. Iapps24 reserves approval authority as to the implementation and use of the Software. Iapps24 may suspend the Software in the event that Iapps24 finds any implementation issues with the Software. Such suspension shall remain in effect until Subscriber corrects any issues specified by Iapps24 and a suspension pursuant hereto shall not relieve Subscriber of its payment obligations under the Agreement.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            f. Registration. Subscriber agrees to provide Iapps24 with current, complete and accurate registration information for the Software and to maintain and properly update such information.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
          <h4>3.Terms.</h4> 
          </p>

The Term of this Agreement shall renew automatically, without requirement of any affirmative act of either Party, upon expiration of the initial Term or any subsequent Term.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
        <h4>  4.	Tools Agreement.</h4></p>
          <p> If Subscriber ever enters into a Tools Agreement with Iapps24, the Parties hereby acknowledge that the terms of this Agreement and the Tools Agreement between the Parties shall both be given full force and effect to the greatest extent possible. In the event that this Agreement and the Tools Agreement between the Parties are incompatible or otherwise conflict with one another, the Parties agree that the terms of this Agreement shall prevail, but only with respect to those terms or provisions wherein a conflict exists, and all non-conflicting terms and provisions shall be given full force and effect. Subscriber further acknowledges that, in the event Subscriber enters into a Tools Agreement with Iapps24, Subscriber’s Tools Agreement with Iapps24 shall be contingent upon Subscriber maintaining this Agreement with Iapps24 for mobile application subscription and, if this Agreement were to be terminated for any reason by either party, Subscriber’s Tools Agreement would be terminated until such time as this Agreement is recommenced or a subsequent Mobile Application Subscription Agreement is effectuated between the Parties.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The terms and provisions of this Article are not intended in any manner to reduce or otherwise restrict the termination provisions set forth in this Agreement and any Tools Agreement between these Parties. <br>
          </p>
          <p><h4>5.	Restrictions and Acknowledgement.</h4> <br>
          </p>

Iapps24 expressly reserves the right to add, change, remove, delete, or otherwise amend functionalities of the Software when such amendments are performed by Iapps24: (1) in an effort to achieve successful acceptance to the Apple mobile application application process; or (2) in an effort to address trademark and/or copyright issues with the Software or its use. <br>
          </p>
         <h4> 6.Proprietary Interests. </h4>

          </p>
          <p>13.	Limitation of Liability. Except as provided below, the remedies and rights of the Parties described in paragraph 12 herein shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties in the event of a breach of this Agreement. In no event will Iapps24 or any representative thereof be liable to Subscriber or any other party for any (a) special, indirect, incidental, exemplary, consequential or punitive damages arising from or related to the Software or the use thereof, the maintenance services, the updates, if any, or to the performance of this Agreement, including but not limited to, damages for loss of data, loss of use, or loss of profits, even if Iapps24 or its representative has been advised in advance of the possibility of such loss or damages. Further, in no event will any representative’s total cumulative liability to subscriber or any other party for claims, losses, or damages of any kind, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, or otherwise, arising out of or related in any way to this Agreement or the Software, exceed the Subscription Fee Subscriber paid to Iapps24 for the Software as of the date of the claim, loss or damage. Subscriber shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or other damages (including loss, profits or savings) resulting from or in connection with this Agreement whether in an action based on contract or tort, including negligence or strict liability and even if Iapps24 has been advised of the possibility of such damages as long as the Subscriber is fully complying with Section 4 (Restrictions and Acknowledgement), Section 5 (Proprietary Interests) and Section 6 (Confidential Information). <br>
          </p>
          <p>14.	Indemnification. Either party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party (the “Indemnified Party”), its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants, representatives and agents from any and all claims, liability, damages and/or costs (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from the Indemnifying Party’s use or misuse of the Software, violation of this Agreement, or infringement of any intellectual property rights or other rights of any person or entity.<br>
          </p>
          <p>15.	Risk Free Period. For the first thirty (30) days following the Activation Date Subscriber shall be able to terminate this Agreement without cost to Subscriber (“Risk Free Period”). To terminate this Agreement during the Risk Free Period, Subscriber must provide Iapps24 with a written notice of termination of the Agreement (“Termination Notice”) which shall state a date on which the Agreement shall terminate (the “Termination Date”). To be eligible for the Risk Free Period, the Termination Notice must occur during the Risk Free Period. Upon successful termination during the Risk Free Period, Iapps24 shall have twenty (20) days from the Termination Notice to refund in full Subscriber for its Subscription Fee. <br>
            <br>
            16.	Termination by Subscriber. Subscriber may at any time provide Iapps24 with a Termination Notice which shall state the Termination Date. Regardless of the cause, or lack thereof, for such termination of this Agreement, Subscriber shall owe Iapps24 for the prorated Subscription Fee for the remainder of the month of the Termination Date, as well as the two subsequent months following the Termination Date (“Termination Penalty”). The Termination Penalty shall be calculated based upon the standard services fee as of the Termination Date, regardless of whether Subscriber received a discounted or otherwise reduced Subscription Fee. Grapnel Mobile shall not be required to provide any Services after the Termination Date.<br>
          </p>
          <p>17.	Termination by Iapps24. <br>
          </p>
          <p>a.	With Cause: If Subscriber shall fail to make any payment when due, including without limitation automatic renewal payments, then upon such non-payment Iapps24 may provide Subscriber with written notice of such non-payment (the “Default Notice”) and unless Subscriber shall pay Grapnel Mobile the amount due within three (3) business days of the issuance of the Default Notice (the “Default Period”), Subscriber shall be deemed to have terminated the Agreement, and Grapnel Mobile shall be entitled to payment from Subscriber as if Subscriber had issued a Termination Notice to Grapnel Mobile on the due date of the payment.<br>
          </p>
          <p>b.	Without Cause: Iapps24 reserves the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason whatsoever, or for no reason at all. In the event that Iapps24 terminates this Agreement Without Cause, Iapps24 shall provide Subscriber with a Termination Notice which shall state the Termination Date. If Iapps24 terminates this Agreement Without Cause, Subscriber shall not be liable for Subscription Fees after the Termination Date and, in the event that Subscriber has prepaid its Subscription Fee in accord with this Agreement, Iapps24 shall refund Subscriber in an amount equal to the unused prorated amount of Subscriber’s Subscription Fee. <br>
          </p>
          <p>18.	Change Orders. Any change, addition, alteration, or amendment otherwise to the Services considered in the Agreement shall be agreed to by both parties through a Written Change Order. Such Written Change Order shall clearly set forth the original Services considered in this Agreement, the proposed changes to the Services, the date of the change, and a signature from each of the Parties herein. Such Written Change Order shall be agreed to by the Parties, and signed by each, prior to any change in the Services is performed. In the event that no change agreement is able to be reached by the Parties, either no change to the Services will result or, in the alternative, the Parties can avail themselves of the remedies set forth in paragraphs 16 and 17 of this Agreement. <br>
          </p>
          <p>19.	Enforcement. This Agreement is to be performed in whole or in part in Polk County, Iowa, and shall be enforceable in the Iowa District Court for Polk County or the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.<br>
          </p>
          <p>The Parties to this Agreement agree that in the event that it shall be necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement that, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other relief to which they may otherwise be entitled, injunctions, and judgments of specific performance may be awarded.<br>
            To the maximum extent allowed by law, the Parties to this Agreement waive the posting of any bond.<br>
          </p>
          <p>If any Party to this Agreement shall seek counsel to enforce the terms hereof, then, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other relief to which they may be entitled, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of their attorneys’ fees (regardless of whether it is ultimately necessary to institute litigation on such matter), expert witness fees (including travel and lodging, if necessary) and court costs (if any) from the other. If the Parties are unable to agree on which Party has prevailed, then such determination shall be made by binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, or such other rules as the Parties shall agree.<br>
          </p>
          <p>20.	Construction/Captions. This Agreement is made in Iowa, to be performed in Iowa and shall be construed in accordance with Iowa law. The captions and headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not in any way limit, amplify, or otherwise modify the provisions of this Agreement. <br>
          </p>
